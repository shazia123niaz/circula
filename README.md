- I have automated test cases using Selenium Web Driver (Java)
- Used TestNG Framework
- Used POM design pattern to create page object classes
- Created folder struture
- In  /assignment/src/test/java created packages
- pageObjects contains (BasePage-contains driver constructor , Page Object Class contains locators and actin methods )
- screenshots 
- testCases (created test cases, Base Class contain reuseable methods like intialize drive, Before Class, After Class, Random String generation methods)
- utilities (added generic test data generation utility)
- In /assignment/src/test/resources added congig.properties (which contain app url )
- test-outPut folder contains report
- pom.xml 
- testsuit.xml
- I have added gihub actions which are running all tests with each commit thus making sure there is no breaking change introduced.
- I prefer atomic commits to keep the history clean and well maintained but this project was under trial and error so i did not focus on atomic commits.
